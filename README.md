Personal Portfolio Website 🚀

This is my personal developer portfolio, currently in progress, built to showcase my projects, skills, and background as I work toward becoming a full-stack software engineer.
The site is being developed using React + Vite with a clean, modern design and a focus on good structure, scalability, and real-world best practices.
